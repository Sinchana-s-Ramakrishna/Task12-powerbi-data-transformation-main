👩‍💻 Objective

The goal of this task was to perform data cleaning and transformation using Power BI Power Query Editor before building a dashboard. This demonstrates real-world data preparation skills required for a Data Analyst role.

🗂 Dataset Used

HR Analytics Dataset containing employee information such as:

Age

Department

Monthly Salary

Years at Company

Job Satisfaction

Attrition (Yes/No)

🔧 Data Transformation Steps (Power Query)

The following transformations were performed:

Cleaned Column Names for better readability

Verified and Corrected Data Types (numbers, text, dates)

Created New Business Columns:

🧠 Age_Group

Categorized employees based on age:

Young (<25)

Adult (25–40)

Senior (>40)

💸 Salary_Band

Grouped salaries into:

Low (<30,000)

Medium (30,000–70,000)

High (>70,000)

📅 Experience_Level

Based on years at company:

Fresher (<3 years)

Mid-Level (3–7 years)

Senior (>7 years)

These transformations help convert raw data into meaningful categories for analysis.

📊 Dashboard Visualizations

The following visuals were created after data transformation:

Attrition by Age Group
Shows which age group has higher employee attrition.

Average Job Satisfaction by Salary Band
Analyzes how salary levels impact employee satisfaction.

Workforce Distribution by Experience Level
Displays the proportion of freshers, mid-level, and senior employees.

Department Slicer (Filter)
Allows dynamic filtering of all visuals by department.
